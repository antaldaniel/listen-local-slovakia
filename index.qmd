### Abstract {.unnumbered}

Across Europe and other advanced music markets, cultural policy instruments such as local content quotas, diversity targets, and equality pledges are widely used to sustain domestic cultural ecosystems. As discussed in the OpenMusE *Green Paper on AI, Data Governance, and Metadata Policies for Europe’s Music Ecosystem*, these instruments have repeatedly struggled at the point of implementation, particularly under conditions of platform scale and data protection constraints. Broadcasters, festival organisers, and other cultural intermediaries are expected to meet quantitative targets, yet they often lack reliable, auditable, and legally safe tools to assess compliance in practice.

This paper responds to that policy analysis by presenting the *Slovak Comprehensive Music Database* (SKCMDb) as an implementation-level pilot within the Open Music Observatory. SKCMDb operationalises diversity- and locality-related policy criteria through a federated, governance-by-design data infrastructure. Rather than exposing personal attributes of composers or performers, the system separates internal evaluation from external disclosure, expressing policy-relevant outcomes as properties of cultural artefacts. This approach enables the computation of eligibility and diversity indicators while respecting the General Data Protection Regulation, non-discrimination principles, and institutional competences.

The paper situates SKCMDb within a broader ecosystem of interoperable modules, including the *Hungarian Music Database* and community-curated Livonian and Karelian music databases, illustrating how the subsidiarity principle articulated in the Green Paper can be implemented across national, community, and supra-national levels. Methodologically, the work combines linked-data modelling, modular ontologies, and provenance-aware workflows with lightweight publication strategies.

An empirical case study based on 156 weeks of official Slovak music charts demonstrates how local content indicators can be computed reproducibly and transparently using authoritative reference data, without monitoring individual broadcasters. The results illustrate the feasibility of diversity-aware cultural policy infrastructures envisioned in the Green Paper and support voluntary compliance, editorial decision-making, and comparative analysis. The paper concludes by outlining implications for European data governance, cultural policy, and the future development of the Open Music Observatory as a prototype European Music Observatory.

## Introduction {#sec-introduction}

Across Europe and other advanced music markets, cultural policy instruments such as local content quotas, diversity targets, and equality pledges have long played an important role in sustaining domestic cultural ecosystems. These instruments reflect a structural asymmetry between global cultural markets and national or regional creative production. While English-language popular music circulates globally with few barriers, music produced in smaller linguistic and cultural markets—such as Slovak music—is consumed predominantly within national borders or among relatively small diaspora communities. For this reason, more than eighty countries worldwide apply some form of preferential treatment to local music and audiovisual production, most commonly through minimum usage shares for public broadcasters and, in many cases, commercial, regional, or community radio stations as well.

In recent European policy debates, these long-standing instruments have acquired renewed significance in the context of the **EU Culture Compass** and the emerging **EU Culture Data Hub**, which aim to support cultural policy with timely, comparable, and evidence-based indicators. Within this framework, diversity and circulation metrics are no longer peripheral reporting tools, but core inputs for monitoring cultural ecosystems, assessing policy impact, and informing strategic decision-making at European level. Yet many of the indicators envisioned in these initiatives—particularly those related to diversity, local representation, and cross-border circulation—have historically been difficult or impossible to measure in a consistent and legally robust manner.

Despite their long history, diversity- and local-content policies have repeatedly struggled at the point of implementation. Broadcasters, festival organisers, and other cultural intermediaries are formally expected to meet quantitative targets, yet they often lack reliable, auditable, and ethically acceptable tools to assess compliance in practice. In the absence of such tools, implementation has frequently relied on informal editorial heuristics, institutional memory, or conservative programming strategies that privilege already well-known repertoire. These practices, while understandable, tend to undermine the intended goals of cultural diversity, renewal, and inclusion, and limit the usefulness of resulting data for European-level aggregation.

The challenge is compounded by scale. Even before the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the rapid expansion of global music distribution platforms had already rendered traditional editorial knowledge insufficient. In the 1990s, a highly experienced radio editor or festival curator in a smaller European country might plausibly have maintained working familiarity with a few tens of thousands of recordings circulating through physical distribution channels. Today, global digital platforms provide access to well over one hundred million recordings. No individual editor can meaningfully survey such a repertoire, yet policy objectives increasingly apply across this vastly expanded universe of available content. This scale effect fundamentally alters the nature of categorisation, assessment, and comparability.

These developments expose a structural mismatch between European cultural policy ambitions and the data infrastructures available to support them. The problem is not primarily one of unwillingness or resistance among cultural intermediaries, but of missing coordination mechanisms capable of translating policy criteria into operational, computable indicators that can be aggregated across institutions and borders. At the same time, any viable solution must respect a core principle of European governance: subsidiarity. Cultural production, heritage, and identity are inherently situated, and data infrastructures that feed into European-level instruments such as the Culture Compass must therefore operate across local, national, and supra-national levels without collapsing these distinctions into a single, centralised system.

The work presented in this paper emerges from this insight. It introduces the *Open Music Observatory (OMO)*—and in particular its *Diversity and Circulation pillar*—as a forerunner and model component of a future *EU Culture Data Hub*. Through the concrete implementation of the *Slovak Comprehensive Music Database* (SKCMDb), developed alongside comparable initiatives such as the *Hungarian Music Database* and community-curated Finno-Ugric music databases, the paper demonstrates how diversity and circulation indicators that were previously considered impractical can be computed reproducibly and responsibly. In doing so, it illustrates how national and community-level data infrastructures can function as live, policy-relevant data sources for European instruments such as the Culture Compass.

This paper proceeds as follows.

-   @sec-feasibility summarises the findings of the feasibility phase that motivated the work. @sec-policy situates the project within the European data governance agenda and outlines, in a concise “policy brief in a nutshell”, the relationship between this implementation work, the Green Paper, and current EU initiatives.

-   @sec-governance provides the path from policy to implementation with explaining governance, architecture and semantic design under the EU's data, cultural and music, and diversity policy umbrella.

-   Sections @sec-methodology and @sec-sensitive-data describe the methodological foundations and the separation of internal evaluation from external disclosure.

-   @sec-application presents the federated implementation and system architecture.

-   @sec-case-study demonstrates the approach through a case study based on official Slovak music charts.

The paper concludes by discussing implications for European cultural policy, data governance, and the future development of the *Open Music Observatory* as a prototype European Music Observatory within the EU Culture Data Hub.

## Findings of the Feasibility Phase {#sec-feasibility}

The *Feasibility Study On Promoting Slovak Music In Slovakia & Abroad*[^4] identified a persistent and structural gap between the normative ambitions of cultural policy and the operational realities of music dissemination. While local content quotas and diversity objectives are typically articulated in legal or institutional terms, they are rarely accompanied by a technical or methodological framework that would allow their consistent application in everyday editorial practice. This gap was not merely practical, but conceptual: policy definitions often relied on categories that could not be coherently mapped onto the objects actually circulated by media platforms.

[^4]: The study was published in English as *Feasibility Study On Promoting Slovak Music In Slovakia & Abroad* and *Projektová štúdia propagácie slovenskej hudby na Slovensku a v zahranicí* in Slovak [@antal_promoting_slovak_2020; @antal_promoting_slovak_2020-SK].

![](png/omo/20240605_D_Antal_Dataweek_OMO_3.png){fig-align="center"}

A central finding concerned the mismatch between **persons** and **cultural artefacts**. Radio stations, streaming platforms, and broadcasters do not distribute composers or performers as such; they distribute recorded fixations of performances, that is, sound recordings. These recordings are cultural artefacts that do not themselves possess personal characteristics. Yet many quota systems implicitly assume that attributes of persons—such as nationality, age, gender identity, ethnicity, or place of residence—can be directly ascribed to the recordings through which music is communicated to the public. This assumption breaks down both conceptually and legally.

Modern European cultural policy does not follow nineteenth-century ethnomusicological traditions that attempted to define what makes music intrinsically “Slovak”, “Hungarian”, or otherwise national. Contemporary quota systems instead operate through **agent-based criteria**: a recording may qualify as local or national if it is a performance of a musical work composed by a person born in, residing in, or otherwise connected to a given country; in other cases, language of lyrics or place of performance may be decisive. In Slovakia, for example, vocal recordings performed in the Slovak language may qualify irrespective of the performer’s place of birth, recording location, or ethnicity. A recording of Slovak folk music performed in Hungary by members of the Slovak ethnolinguistic minority may therefore legitimately count toward both Hungarian and Slovak quota systems.

At the same time, European quota systems are constrained by fundamental legal principles, including the prohibition of discrimination based on ethnicity, nationality, or other protected characteristics. Cultural policy may promote linguistic diversity, local cultural ecosystems, or underrepresented groups, but it cannot lawfully categorise or exclude works on the basis of ethnic identity. This legal constraint is not a weakness of European quota systems; rather, it reflects a normative commitment to pluralism and equal treatment. It also opens space for precisely the kinds of cross-border and minority cases illustrated by Slovak folk music performed in Hungary or Hungarian-language folk traditions maintained by Csángó communities in Romania.

The feasibility work was strongly influenced by insights from **intersectional data feminism**, particularly the recognition that data-related inequalities do not arise along a single axis, but through the accumulation and interaction of multiple structural asymmetries. In the global music industry, the visibility advantage of an American male star cannot be meaningfully compared to the position of a Slovak female composer, nor to that of a Csángó woman singing in a distinct Hungarian dialect in Romania. These cases sit at the intersection of linguistic marginality, gender imbalance, ethnic minority status, and unequal access to global distribution infrastructures. Treating any one of these dimensions in isolation risks reproducing, rather than mitigating, existing inequalities.

Importantly, this intersectional perspective also revealed that diversity-oriented policies must not be framed as opposing “majority” and “minority” interests in simplistic ways. Most European national music ecosystems—regardless of internal gender or ethnic hierarchies—are themselves structurally marginal within the global music economy. From this perspective, the protection of cultural diversity includes not only historically marginalised groups, but also majority male performers operating within small national markets whose repertoire competes with overwhelmingly dominant global catalogues. A European diversity framework must therefore protect all participants in fragile cultural ecosystems, while remaining attentive to internal power asymmetries.

These observations further complicate the already problematic linkage between personal attributes and recordings. A single sound recording may involve multiple composers, lyricists, performers, arrangers, and producers, each situated differently across axes of gender, language, ethnicity, nationality, and residence. Group identities are fluid, and personal circumstances change over time. Attempting to stabilise these attributes at the level of the recording risks both conceptual incoherence and ethical overreach, particularly under data protection law.

The feasibility study therefore concluded that sustainable implementation requires a **decoupling of internal evaluation from external disclosure**, informed by an intersectional understanding of power and inequality. Rather than exposing personal attributes or identity categories, a system must be able to evaluate eligibility internally—within a legally justified, institutionally competent, and ethically governed environment—and expose only the outcome of that evaluation at the level of the artefact. In this model, a recording may be labelled as meeting or not meeting a quota requirement, without revealing which contributor, which protected characteristic, or which intersection of attributes triggered eligibility.

This conclusion marked a decisive reframing of the problem. Local content and diversity policies could no longer be treated as matters of editorial judgement alone, nor as enforcement exercises aimed at individuals. Instead, they emerged as **intersectional information design problems**: how to construct reference infrastructures that translate policy rules into computable properties of cultural artefacts, while respecting non-discrimination, data protection, institutional competence, and the complex social realities of European cultural production. Crucially, this reframing also opened a path toward indicators that can be aggregated, compared, and reused beyond a single national context, providing the conceptual and methodological preconditions for diversity and circulation metrics capable of informing European-level data infrastructure.

## Policy Context and Relationship to the Green Paper {#sec-policy}

### European Cultural Policy Framework: Compass, Data Hub, and Music as a Forerunner

This paper takes the European Union’s emerging cultural policy framework as a given. The *Culture Compass for Europe*, the planned *EU Culture Data Hub*, and recent European Parliament resolutions establish shared political destinations: strengthening cultural and linguistic diversity, improving the visibility and circulation of European cultural content, and enabling evidence-based policy through trustworthy data infrastructures[^5]. These initiatives do not prescribe sector-specific implementations, but they clearly signal the need for operational data flows capable of supporting observability at European scale.

[^5]: *Regulation (EU) 2022/868 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2022 on European data governance and amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1724* (Data Governance Act) [@regulation_dga_2022_868]

!["Recognising the EU’s supporting role in the field of culture, this declaration affirms shared political commitments and responsibilities of the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission - within their respective competencies and in full compliance with EU law - based on the key directions set out in the Commission’s 2025 Culture Compass for Europe."](png/eupolicies/Draft_Joint_Declaration_Europe_for_Culture_6x4.png){width="100%" fig-align="center"}

Within this framework, music constitutes a particularly suitable forerunner domain. Music is highly digitised, deeply platform-mediated, and characterised by complex cross-border circulation. At the same time, it combines strong public-interest objectives—such as diversity, cultural sovereignty, and fair remuneration—with mature sectoral institutions, including collective management organisations, national libraries, and public broadcasters. These characteristics make music an early stress test for the kinds of data infrastructures envisioned by the Culture Compass and the EU Culture Data Hub.

The Open Music Observatory is positioned as a sectoral implementation that can contribute empirical evidence to this broader European architecture. Rather than functioning as a central repository, it operates as a federated observability layer capable of aggregating indicators from national and community-level data sources while respecting subsidiarity and institutional competence. In this sense, the diversity and circulation pillar documented in this paper illustrates how live, policy-relevant indicators can be generated and, in principle, fed into European-level instruments without centralising data or authority.

By demonstrating how previously difficult or impossible-to-measure aspects of music diversity and circulation can be made observable in practice, the music case provides early implementation feedback for the *EU Culture Data Hub* and the *Culture Compass*. It shows how sectoral data spaces can supply continuous, auditable inputs to European cultural policy while remaining grounded in existing institutional ecosystems. The music implementation presented here should therefore be read as a forerunner contribution—informative for other cultural domains, but not prescriptive beyond its sectoral scope.

### Analytical Foundations: From the CITF Background Study to the OpenMusE Green Paper {#sec-citf}

The analytical foundations of this work build on two Commission-commissioned studies that approach the same structural problem from different entry points: the *Study on copyright and new technologies – Copyright data management and artificial intelligence* [^6] and the OpenMusE *Green Paper on AI, Data Governance, and Metadata Policies for Europe’s Music Ecosystem*[^7]. While situated in different policy contexts, the two studies draw on a shared evidence base and structure that evidence in closely comparable ways.

[^6]: European Commission. *Study on copyright and new technologies – Copyright data management and artificial intelligence*, 2022 [@study_on_copyright_new_technologies_2022].

[^7]: Open Music Europe. *A Green Paper on AI, Data Governance, and Metadata Policies for Europe’s Music Ecosystem* [@open_music_greenpaper].

The 2022 study, prepared in the context of copyright and AI policy, identified fragmented metadata, weak authority control, and the absence of trustworthy, machine-readable reference sources as systemic barriers to lawful AI use, licensing, and cross-border reuse. Crucially, it framed these challenges as infrastructural rather than sector-specific, arguing for layered data ecosystems composed of authoritative sources, interoperability and reconciliation mechanisms, and downstream applications. This analytical framing later informed the work of the Copyright Infrastructure Task Force (CITF) and its first concrete implementation project[^8].

[^8]: *Interoperable, Trustworthy, and Machine-Readable Copyright Data in the AI Era: Report of the CITF First Project* [@citf_2025].

The OpenMusE Green Paper arrives at closely aligned conclusions, but from a different vantage point and at a later point in time. Developed within a large Research and Innovation Action, it is analytical in purpose but explicitly implementation-informed. Its analysis is grounded in several years of practical experience with live data infrastructures in the music sector, including national, community-curated, and federated European-level components. As a result, the Green Paper does not merely anticipate infrastructural needs, but reflects on observed constraints, governance trade-offs, and design choices encountered in real deployments.

Both studies therefore converge on similar policy-relevant insights not because one derives from the other, but because they observe the same underlying evidence. Each recognises that effective policy intervention in the digital cultural domain depends on the availability of authoritative reference data, provenance-aware interoperability layers, and governance arrangements that respect institutional competence and fundamental rights. The difference lies in emphasis and maturity: the 2022 study articulates the problem space and solution logic in a cross-sectoral, anticipatory manner, while the Green Paper confirms and refines that logic through sector-specific implementation experience in music.

In this sense, the Green Paper can be understood as playing a role analogous to the CITF background study, while benefiting from later timing and empirical grounding. The present paper builds on both analytical foundations. It follows the layered infrastructural logic articulated in the 2022 study and reflected in the Green Paper, while operating at a level of concreteness comparable to the CITF First Project. The focus on diversity and circulation should therefore be read not as a separate policy agenda, but as one analytically distinct facet of the same data governance challenge that underpins economic sustainability, discoverability, and rights remuneration in the European music ecosystem.

### The Green Paper in a Nutshell: Section Overview {#sec-green-paper}

The OpenMusE *Green Paper on AI, Data Governance, and Metadata Policies for Europe’s Music Ecosystem* is structured as a sequence of five analytical sections. Each section starts from an existing European policy objective or regulatory context, analyses the corresponding data and infrastructure challenges observed in the music ecosystem, and concludes with concrete, implementation-oriented recommendations.

1.  [Policy Context and Problem Map↗](https://downloads.reprex.nl/2025/greenpaper/context.html)\
    This section situates the European music ecosystem within the European Data Strategy, cultural policy objectives, and AI governance debates. It analyses how policy goals such as cultural diversity, market transparency, and lawful AI use are constrained by fragmented and poorly governed music data. It recommends treating music observability as a data infrastructure problem rather than a purely regulatory one.

2.  [Fixing Music Data at the Source↗](https://downloads.reprex.nl/2025/greenpaper/curation.html)\
    This section analyses structural weaknesses in music metadata creation and maintenance, including inconsistent identifiers, weak authority control, and misaligned incentives across the value chain. It recommends strengthening authoritative reference sources and improving data quality at the point of creation as a prerequisite for downstream policy, economic, and AI-related uses.

3.  [Open Music Observatory: Building a Shared Music Data Space↗](https://downloads.reprex.nl/2025/greenpaper/observatory.html) This section analyses how European data-space principles—federation, interoperability, and governance-by-design—can be applied in the music sector. It introduces the Open Music Observatory as a shared, federated data space that connects national, community, and European-level data infrastructures. It recommends a layered architecture that enables comparability and aggregation without centralising control.

4.  [AI that Works for Music, Not Against It↗](https://downloads.reprex.nl/2025/greenpaper/ai.html) This section analyses the interaction between AI systems and music data, focusing on training, discovery, and automated reuse. It examines risks related to provenance loss, bias amplification, and extractive reuse. It recommends provenance-aware, rights-respecting, and auditable data pipelines as conditions for trustworthy AI in the music ecosystem.

5.  [What Europe Should Do Next for Music Data & AI↗](https://downloads.reprex.nl/2025/greenpaper/conclusion.html)  The final section synthesises the analytical findings and translates them into actionable directions for European institutions, Member States, and sectoral actors. It recommends prioritising implementation pilots, supporting sectoral data spaces, and using concrete deployments to generate empirical feedback for ongoing policy processes.

The present paper focuses on one such implementation pathway. It follows the same analytical logic as the Green Paper but narrows the scope to diversity and circulation, documenting how policy objectives identified in the Green Paper can be translated into working data infrastructures in practice.

The *Green Paper* draws in part on the Slovak, Hungarian, and Finno-Ugric cases presented here, situating them within a wider European policy discussion. It was prepared in consultation with more than ten national and pan-European stakeholders and followed the *Open Policy Guidelines* as a measure of transparency and quality control[^9]. Rather than repeating its findings here, we treat the Green Paper as a complementary policy artefact that reflects back on the kinds of implementation-level lessons documented in this paper and connects them to ongoing European debates on data spaces, AI governance, and cultural policy.

[^9]: The *Guidelines for Open Policy Analysis* form an actionable and practical set of directives that the OpenMusE consoritum was mandated to use under the Grant Agreement. It can be seen as good implementation framework for *Evidence-based policy making in the European Commission* and *The practice of reproducible research* [@opa_guidelines; @openmuse_2023; @evidence_based_policy_eu_2015; @practice_of_reproducible_research_2018].

### From Analysis to Implementation: CITF First Project (Books) and Music as a Parallel Case {#sec-citf-first-project}

This paper documents an implementation that operates at the same level of maturity as the *CITF First Project* in the book sector. In both cases, earlier analytical work is translated into concrete, working data infrastructures that can be assessed under real legal, institutional, and organisational conditions. Neither implementation seeks to set policy or redefine regulatory frameworks; rather, both test how shared analytical principles can be realised in practice.

Both implementations build on a common layered infrastructural logic. Authoritative reference sources form the foundation; interoperability, reconciliation, and provenance mechanisms enable alignment across systems; and downstream applications make the data usable for policy, licensing, analytics, and AI-related purposes. This three-layer model, articulated in the CITF background study and reflected in the Green Paper, provides a shared analytical basis across domains.

The two implementations diverge not in principle, but in the degree of elaboration required by their respective domains. The *CITF First Project* focuses on the book sector, where rights management and data workflows are comparatively linear and where initial use cases often concern non-commercial or low-complexity material, such as academic theses. In this context, the three-layer model can be operationalised with relatively limited emphasis on organisational interoperability. By contrast, the music sector involves substantially more complex workflows. A single musical artefact may simultaneously intersect with libraries, collective management organisations, publishers, record labels, distributors, and platforms, each using overlapping data elements within distinct organisational and legal contexts. For this reason, the Open Music Observatory implementation explicitly follows the European Interoperability Framework (EIF)[^10], placing greater emphasis on the organisational layer that mediates between legal requirements and semantic alignment. This choice is not a departure from the CITF model, but a domain-driven extension that becomes necessary as workflow complexity increases.

[^10]: European Commission. *European Interoperability Framework – Implementation Strategy*, 2017 [@eif_2017].

Governance arrangements in the two cases are likewise comparable. The *CITF First Project* emerged through voluntary, pioneer cooperation among willing Member States and sectoral institutions, without the creation of new mandates or the reallocation of legal authority. The *Open Music Observatory* follows the same governance logic. In Slovakia, cooperation is formalised through a Memorandum of Understanding that establishes shared principles for data stewardship, transparency, and open policy analysis while fully preserving institutional competences[^11]. Replication efforts in Hungary and other regions follow similar voluntary patterns, albeit at different levels of maturity. In both cases, governance-by-design and trust-based cooperation are preconditions for implementation.

[^11]: *Memorandum o porozumení o využití výsledkov analýz otvorených politík v kontexte slovenského kultúrneho a kreatívneho priemyslu a sektorových verejných politík v spolupráci s konzorciom pre výskum a inovácie s názvom OpenMuse*. \[Memorandum of Understanding on utilizing the Open Policy Analysis results of the OpenMuse Research and Innovation Consortium in the context of Slovak cultural and creative industries and sectors' public policies\] [@open_music_europe_sk_mou_2023]

The two projects also exhibit complementary strengths. The *CITF First Project* achieves broader geographical reach at an earlier stage, demonstrating that the model can be extended across multiple jurisdictions. The *Open Music Observatory* implementation prioritises depth over breadth, developing a more layered and workflow-sensitive implementation within a smaller number of territories. This trade-off is deliberate and informative: taken together, the two approaches show that the shared analytical model can scale both horizontally, across countries, and vertically, across increasingly complex organisational environments.

Finally, the focus on diversity and circulation in the music case should be understood as analytically inseparable from economic and rights-related concerns. In data-driven cultural ecosystems, discoverability, circulation, and remuneration depend on the same underlying infrastructures of identification, authority control, and provenance. Music that cannot be reliably identified and made visible within such infrastructures cannot circulate effectively and cannot generate sustainable income for rightsholders. Diversity-oriented indicators and economic indicators therefore represent complementary perspectives on the same infrastructural problem.

On this basis, the following sections describe the methodological and architectural choices through which the music implementation was realised, showing how policy objectives can be translated into concrete, interoperable data infrastructures in practice.

### Diversity and Circulation as the Other Side of the Economic Equation

In the music sector, diversity, discoverability, circulation, and remuneration are not separate policy domains but interdependent outcomes of the same underlying data infrastructure. Music that cannot be reliably identified, contextualised, and linked across systems cannot be found by audiences, programmed by intermediaries, or remunerated through rights management systems. From this perspective, diversity indicators and economic indicators represent different views on the same infrastructural capacity: the ability of the ecosystem to make European music visible and actionable in data-driven environments.

Historically, diversity policies have often been treated as normative or corrective instruments, while economic sustainability has been addressed through market mechanisms and rights enforcement. In digital music ecosystems, this separation no longer holds. Algorithmic discovery, platform analytics, and automated rights processing rely on shared metadata pipelines. Where these pipelines are fragmented or unreliable, both diversity objectives and economic outcomes fail simultaneously. A repertoire that is invisible to discovery systems will not circulate, and a repertoire that does not circulate will not generate income, regardless of its cultural value.

The focus on diversity and circulation in this paper should therefore be understood as an analytical entry point into a broader economic problem, not as a departure from it. By examining how local, linguistic, and culturally specific repertoire can be made observable without exposing personal data or essentialising identity, the implementation described here addresses the same infrastructural conditions required for fair remuneration and sustainable markets. Diversity metrics become a stress test for the data infrastructure’s ability to support lawful, auditable, and scalable reuse.

In this sense, diversity-oriented observability functions as an early and demanding use case. If an infrastructure can support reliable measurement of circulation and representation under strict legal and ethical constraints, it can also support more conventional economic indicators. The diversity and circulation pillar of the Open Music Observatory thus serves both as a policy-relevant implementation in its own right and as a proxy for the broader economic health of the European music ecosystem.

## From Policy to Implementation: Governance, Architecture, and Semantic Design {#sec-governance}

### Governance as an Implementation Method

From the outset, the *Open Music Observatory* implementations treated governance as a methodological problem rather than an administrative layer. European cultural policy is structurally multi-level: cultural competences reside primarily at national and regional levels (including federal and Länder-based systems), while the European Union operates through coordination, support, and aggregation. Any viable implementation must therefore align with this reality, enabling subnational, national, and supranational participation without assuming a single centre of authority. Governance, in this context, becomes the method through which policy objectives are translated into workable infrastructures across levels.[^12]

[^12]: See the European Data Strategy and the emphasis on coordination, subsidiarity, and sectoral data spaces [@european_data_strategy_2020; @regulation_dga_2022_868].

At national level, this logic was formalised in Slovakia through a *Memorandum of Understanding* between the Ministry of Culture, its analytical unit (IKP), and the OpenMusE consortium, later amended with a more specific MoU among the *SOZA*, *Slovak Music Centre*, the *Music Fund*, and the *Slovak National Library*, and *Reprex* as the technology partner. Both MoUs deliberately avoids mandating data transfer, standardisation, or compliance. Instead, it establishes shared analytical principles—open policy analysis, methodological transparency, and non-exclusive cooperation—while preserving institutional competences.[^13] This governance choice is reflected in the technical design of the Slovak module, which is documented separately in the Open Music Observatory technical documentation and treated as a living specification rather than a fixed standard.[^14]

In Hungary, a comparable level of centralised coordination could not be achieved at the outset. As a result, the Hungarian implementation followed a deliberately bottom-up trajectory. Building on the Slovak template and its early public articulation in conference presentations, the Hungarian work progressed through a series of bilateral agreements, exploratory workshops, and open professional discussions with individual institutions. This process involved sustained dialogue with archival, heritage, and research actors, rather than a single coordinating authority. While slower and more fragmented, this bottom-up approach proved well suited to the Hungarian institutional landscape and ultimately produced a governance structure aligned with local capacities, traditions, and trust relationships. In this sense, the divergence between the Slovak and Hungarian governance paths is not a deviation from the shared architectural vision, but an expression of the subsidiarity principle in practice[^15].

[^15]: Presented at the annual conference of library and GLAM information management conference, the A szlovák adatkicserélési tér magyarországi föderációjának lehetőségei [@antal_hungarnet_2024] was followed by numerous bilateral and open professional forums.

The Hungarian implementation follows the same architectural and governance principles but emerged through a more bottom-up trajectory, reflecting different institutional histories and capacities. Cooperation developed incrementally through professional dialogue among archival, heritage, and research institutions rather than through a single coordinating authority.[^16]

[^16]: See professional discussions and early replication pathways presented at HungarNet and related forums [@antal_hungarnet_2024].

The Hungarian data sharing space does not have yet an end-user facing surface and an API. It exists as a data sharing space that connects several national-level databases, as explained in *Enriching and Futureproofing the Databases of the Hungarian Heritage House*[^17], and in the service integration around the databases of the *Hungarian House of Music* (explained later.)

[^17]: A short feasibility study and early manuscript for publication, which is the developing manuscript for a separate publication [@antal_zagyyva_2025].

An emerging Polish track further illustrates how this governance pattern can be extended without requiring uniform legal instruments or synchronised institutional readiness. The Polish implementation is at an even earlier stage, and we are in the phase of replication design, and design of data curation workflows.

Below the national level, the *Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space* (FUDSS) makes subsidiarity operational in its most demanding form. It engages subnational and community-scale actors—regional archives, village museums, research groups, and community organisations—often operating across borders and outside state-scale cultural infrastructures. Such actors are frequently referenced in European policy discourse on cultural diversity, minorities, and regions, yet are rarely integrated into European data infrastructures in practice. The *Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space* includes community-curated databases for Livonian and Karelian musical heritage. In these cases, the institutional depth of a nation state—such as that available in Slovakia or Hungary—is largely absent. Livonian and Karelian heritage is preserved by a small number of dedicated regional GLAM institutions, research centres, NGOs, and community organisations, including the Livonian Institute.

Under these conditions, a centrally coordinated governance model would be neither feasible nor appropriate. Instead, the implementation necessarily resembles community-driven approaches familiar from infrastructures such as Wikidata, MusicBrainz, or Discogs, albeit combined with more explicit data curation and governance safeguards. Authority is distributed, participation is voluntary, and trust is built through transparent methods rather than formal mandate.

FUDSS functions as a methodological stress test for whether European frameworks can reach the smallest custodians of cultural heritage without forcing them into state-centric, platform-centric, or extractive governance models.[^18]

[^18]: *Federating Open Knowledge through Wikibase: The Case of the Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space* [@fudss_preprint; @finnougric_2025].

-   The **Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space** is available at [https://finnougric.net/](https://finnougric.net/en/).

At the same time, the *Open Music Observatory* explicitly incorporates a supranational layer. Beyond the Slovak, Hungarian, Polish, and Finno-Ugric modules, a central observatory layer is designed to aggregate indicators, support comparison, and feed policy-relevant evidence upward without absorbing authority or data stewardship. This layer mirrors the governance position of European cultural infrastructures such as *Europeana*, the *European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH)*, the *Culture Compass*, and the planned *EU Culture Data Hub*: coordinative rather than directive, integrative rather than extractive.[^19] Comparable governance logics have long been present in European broadcasting and cultural data coordination practices, including those developed within the EBU context.[^20]

[^19]: *Draft Joint Declaration “Europe for Culture — Culture for Europe”* and related Culture Compass materials [@eu_culture_compass_joint_declaration_draft_2025].

[^20]: Governance practices discussed in European broadcasting and metadata coordination contexts, including CISAC and EBU-related forums [@openmuse_cisac_ec_2025].

Taken together, these four modules—subnational (Finno-Ugric), national (Slovak), replicated national (Hungarian and emerging Polish), and supranational—constitute a governance model rather than a single system. They demonstrate how European cultural data infrastructures can operate simultaneously downward and upward: enabling the participation of the smallest cultural actors, supporting national policy implementation, and supplying aggregated observability at European level. In this sense, the Open Music Observatory does not merely align with *Europeana*, *ECCCH*, the *Culture Compass*, or the future *EU Data Hub*; it offers a concrete governance pattern for how such infrastructures can respect subsidiarity while remaining analytically and operationally coherent across Europe.

This governance approach also provides the basis for a direct comparison with the *Copyright Infrastructure Task Force (CITF) First Project*. As discussed in the following subsection, both initiatives translate prior analytical work into concrete, voluntary implementations under real institutional constraints. The comparison is therefore not conceptual but practical: it examines how shared analytical principles—layered infrastructures, respect for competence, and governance-by-design—are realised in different cultural domains, with books and music presenting distinct but comparable challenges.

The CITF First Project offers a reference implementation in a domain with relatively linear workflows and limited actor diversity (see @sec-citf-first-project). The Open Music Observatory implementation operates at the same maturity level but addresses a structurally more complex ecosystem involving simultaneous coordination among libraries, collective management organisations, broadcasters, platforms, and community custodians. The governance patterns outlined above—particularly the emphasis on subsidiarity, voluntary participation, and non-extractive aggregation—form the common ground on which this comparison is made.

### Architectural Commitments under Policy Constraints

The architectural design of the *Open Music Observatory* is shaped by policy constraints rather than technical convenience.

> European cultural policy operates under strict limits on centralisation, competence transfer, and personal data processing.

As a result, the architecture does not aim to consolidate music data into a single repository or to replace authoritative sectoral systems. Instead, it is explicitly designed as an observability layer: a structure that computes indicators, exposes aggregates, and links back to authoritative sources while leaving data ownership, stewardship, and legal responsibility in place[^21].

[^21]: This architectural position reflects core principles of the European Data Strategy and the Data Governance Act, which emphasise interoperability, data sovereignty, and the avoidance of unnecessary centralisation in public-interest data infrastructures [@regulation_dga_2022_868].

Federation is therefore a foundational commitment rather than a transitional solution. The architecture assumes the coexistence of multiple authorities, heterogeneous data sources, and uneven institutional maturity across Europe[^22].

[^22]: The federated observability model aligns with the governance logic articulated for *Europeana*, the *European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage* (ECCCH), and the *Culture Compass for Europe*, all of which rely on aggregation and coordination rather than directive control [@federation_wg_position_2023; @eu_culture_compass_joint_declaration_draft_2025].

National, subnational, community, and European-level components are treated as structurally distinct yet interoperable elements. This mirrors the logic of European cultural infrastructures such as *Europeana* and *ECCCH* and aligns with the design assumptions of the *Culture Compass* and the planned *EU Culture Data Hub*, which require comparability and aggregation without harmonisation by force.

A second core commitment is the strict separation of authority, computation, and publication. Authoritative data remains under the control of competent institutions—libraries, archives, collective management organisations, broadcasters, and community custodians. The Open Music Observatory performs reconciliation, aggregation, and indicator computation without assuming decision-making authority over the underlying data. This separation is essential for lawful participation under GDPR, for maintaining institutional trust, and for enabling voluntary cooperation across public, private, and community actors[^23].

[^23]: This design choice reflects both European data protection law, in particular the*General Data Protection Regulation* (GDPR), and the *CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance*, which complement FAIR data principles by foregrounding authority, responsibility, and ethical use in community and heritage data contexts [@gdpr_2016_679; @carroll_care_2020].

The architecture also commits to workflow-aware interoperability. Music data circulates through fundamentally different organisational contexts, each with its own legal obligations, vocabularies, and practices. Rather than imposing a single semantic model, the architecture accommodates overlapping and partially incompatible representations, focusing on alignment where necessary and divergence where meaningful. This approach reflects the European Interoperability Framework’s emphasis on organisational and semantic layers and recognises that semantic coherence in complex cultural ecosystems must be negotiated rather than enforced[^24].

[^24]: The emphasis on organisational and semantic interoperability follows the European Interoperability Framework (EIF), which explicitly recognises that legal, organisational, semantic, and technical layers must be aligned differently in complex, multi-actor public-sector ecosystems [@eif_2017; @eif_implementation_strategy_en_2017].

Finally, provenance and auditability are treated as first-order architectural constraints. Every indicator produced by the observatory is traceable to its source, transformation steps, and assumptions. This is not merely a technical safeguard but a policy requirement: without provenance, indicators cannot support accountability, nor can they safely feed into AI-driven environments or European-level policy instruments. By embedding provenance at architectural level, the Open Music Observatory enables continuous, auditable feedback into European cultural policy while respecting the limits of authority and competence that define the European governance model.

Recent discussions within the European cultural heritage sector further underline the importance of provenance-aware data governance in the age of AI. A joint *Impulse Paper* by the Open Future Foundation and the Europeana Foundation examines how cultural heritage institutions can navigate large-scale data publishing and AI reuse while preserving public accountability, authority, and trust. It highlights that, once cultural data enters automated and AI-driven environments, incomplete or degraded provenance is no longer a marginal archival issue but a structural risk that shapes downstream use at scale. While the focus of that work is cross-domain, its conclusions closely resonate with the challenges observed in music, reinforcing the need to treat authority control, attribution, and lifecycle-aware governance as core infrastructural concerns rather than sector-specific exceptions. [@publishing_CHD_AI_2025]

### Semantic Design as Policy Translation

In the Open Music Observatory, semantic design functions as a mechanism for translating policy objectives into computable form. Cultural policy concepts such as “local repertoire,” “diversity,” “circulation,” or “European works” are not natively machine-readable; they must be operationalised through explicit distinctions between works, recordings, performances, agents, and contexts of use. The semantic layer therefore acts as the point where legal definitions, policy intentions, and sectoral practices are reconciled into shared, auditable meanings.

The design choices adopted here were not developed in isolation, but informed through sustained consultation with sectoral knowledge institutions and rights organisations.

![fadas](png/iamic/01_Slides_D_Antal_IAMIC_20241121.png){fig-align="center"}

Our approach presented here was co-presented jointly with the Slovak Music Centre, an IAMIC member organisation, at the *International Association of Music Information Centres* General Assembly and Annual Conference (Music Austria, Vienna, 21 November 2024). Discussions with music information and documentation centres from several EU Member States focused on the feasibility of replicating the Slovak model—both its governance arrangements and its technical architecture—within different national institutional environments. See the presentation and poster format [@skcmdb_iamic_poster_2024].

We presented and discussed these ideas jointly with the Slovak Music Centre at the *International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centers* (IAML) during their General Assembly and Annual Conference (Salzburg, 7–9 July 2025), within the “Future Libraries” session and the poster session. See the presentation and poster format [@skcmdb_iaml_presentation_2025; @skcmdb_iaml_poster_2025].

The discussion focused on the role of national music libraries and documentation centres as data stewards within federated cultural data spaces. Feedback from IAML participants contributed to clarifying the library-oriented replication pathway and helped accelerate the otherwise slow Hungarian replication process, supported by the positive reception of IAMIC Hungary. The exchange also identified potential future replication interest in Portugal, Finland, and Denmark, although these initiatives are likely to materialise beyond the timeline of the Open Music Europe project. These discussion reinforced the parallels with the first CITF project, highlighting the regulatory and standardisation roles of national libraries are authority control bodies (see @sec-citf-first-project).

![CISAC European Committee Meeting as OpenMusE: Towards a Sustainable Licensing Market for AI Use of Protected Works in Vilnius, on 29 April 2025.](png/cisac/20250427_CISAC_EC_2025_OpenMusE_2x1.png){fig-align="center"}

Our work was also presented at the CISAC European Committee Meeting as *OpenMusE: Towards a Sustainable Licensing Market for AI Use of Protected Works* in Vilnius, on 29 April 2025 [@openmuse_cisac_ec_2025] in comparison with similar metadata governance and repair initiatives from several countries. Our presentation differentiated itself from similar projects in Finland and the United Kingdom with not only fixing the metadata at source *in the future*, but also focusing on legacy metadata repair. Given that the current copyright and neighboring right protection terms will require rights managements for 20th century assets well into the later part of the 21st century, our focus on not only future-proofing, but past-proofing with legacy system interoperability set our approach apart.

These consultations highlighted a recurring tension: the same musical artefact is described, classified, and used differently by libraries, archives, collective management organisations, broadcasters, and platforms. Semantic interoperability therefore cannot mean semantic uniformity.

To address this, the Observatory adopts a modular semantic strategy based on ontological patterns rather than a single comprehensive schema. Core distinctions—such as between musical works, sound recordings, and performances—are stabilised, while domain-specific vocabularies are allowed to coexist at the edges. This enables alignment with library-oriented standards (e.g. authority control and bibliographic description), industry metadata practices (e.g. ISRC, ISWC, DDEX-aligned workflows), and rights-management perspectives, without forcing any actor to abandon its internal epistemology.

This approach directly reflects feedback from IAML and IAMIC consultations, where national music libraries and documentation centres emphasised the need to preserve scholarly and archival integrity, as well as from CISAC-related discussions, where collective management organisations stressed legal precision, provenance, and accountability. Semantic design thus becomes a negotiated space: not an abstract exercise, but a governance-sensitive process that encodes institutional competences and legal responsibilities into the data model itself.

In this sense, semantic design performs the same function for music diversity and circulation as the layered infrastructure does for copyright data in the *CITF First Project* (see @sec-citf-first-project). In both cases, policy translation depends on making concepts computable without collapsing institutional differences. The music case demonstrates that, as policy questions become more complex—combining cultural diversity, rights management, and algorithmic mediation—semantic design must explicitly account for organisational workflows and use contexts. This makes it a central implementation method, not a downstream technical detail.

## Methodological Considerations {#sec-methodology}

### Data Modelling and Representation

Data modelling in the *Open Music Observatory* is driven by policy questions rather than by aspirations of exhaustive description. The objective is **not** to construct a complete or universal model of music, but to represent those entities and relationships that are necessary to make cultural policy objectives—such as diversity, circulation, and observability—computable under real-world legal and institutional constraints. As a result, modelling choices are deliberately selective, pragmatic, and oriented toward traceability rather than completeness.

In October 2023, a dedicated work session convened by the Polifonia project brought together stakeholders including Podiumkunst.net, the Open Music Observatory, the University of Florence, IC Fonseca School, Joséphine Simonnot/PRISM, Maria Luisa Onida/D'Istruzione Superiore Leonardo Da Vinci, the Carnegie Hall Archive, and the Municipality of Bologna[^25]. This consultation played a formative role in refining the modular ontology strategy adopted here, helping to ensure compatibility between scholarly music-knowledge graphs and policy-oriented interoperability requirements, while avoiding premature ontological closure.

[^25]: *The Polifonia Ontology Network: Building a Semantic Backbone for Musical Heritage* [@de_berardinis_polifonia_2023] and *Engineering Ontologies with Patterns – The eXtreme Design Methodology* [@blomqvist_engineering_2016]

At this stage, we started to record user stories for the design of system competences of the *Open Music Europe* software ecosystem and the observatory's semantic architecture[^26].

[^26]: The user stories were placed in an OPA compliant folder on GitHub. This work was not carried on after the initiated grant agreement change, when the WP4 did no longer participate in building open source software for this purpose, but we did not abandon the competency requirements [@ome_user_stories].

A key methodological insight was that such interoperability could not be achieved through a single, monolithic ontology. Instead, we adopted a **modular approach based on ontological patterns**, inspired in part by the Polifonia Ontology Network but driven by different priorities. While Polifonia emphasises scholarly completeness and expressive richness, our primary objective was sufficient interoperability across existing standards and practices. The resulting data model is intentionally selective. It is designed to interoperate, where necessary, with DDEX-aligned industry metadata, Dublin Core–oriented library and research resources, ISWC-based author identification used by collective management organisations, and ISRC-based recording identification used in neighbouring rights management. This modularity allows different communities to engage with the system at different levels of granularity, without forcing full semantic alignment.

A foundational methodological decision is the explicit separation between different types of musical entities that are often conflated in practice: musical works, sound recordings, and performances. Sound recordings are the primary artefacts circulated by broadcasters and platforms and therefore form the operational basis for measurement and indicators. Musical works, by contrast, are abstract intellectual entities governed by authors’ rights and collective management regimes. Performances occupy a third category, representing time-bound social events with fluid participation and contextual significance. Treating these entities as interchangeable would obscure both legal distinctions and policy relevance. Their separation in the data model precedes any evaluation logic and underpins all subsequent computation.

The representation of agents—composers, performers, ensembles, producers, and institutions—is similarly constrained by policy and legal considerations. Personal attributes are not modelled for public exposure or direct analytical use. Instead, where policy criteria depend on characteristics of contributors, these are evaluated internally by competent institutions and expressed externally only through artefact-level outcomes (for example, whether a recording qualifies under a given policy rule). This modelling strategy supports lawful internal evaluation while avoiding the disclosure or stabilisation of sensitive personal data, aligning representation choices with governance and data protection requirements.

![Graph databases allow to work with incomplete data, and they can connect into various person, work, or recording databases that follow a graph or relational structure. Their structure is optimised to increase knowledge, not to retrieve the same relations many times over, this is why they are usually used for knowledge bases.](png/graph/graph_with_music.png){fig-align="center"}

To support interoperability across heterogeneous systems, the data model relies on graph-based representations rather than flat relational structures. Graphs provide the flexibility required to express multiple, overlapping relationships between works, recordings, agents, places, languages, and institutions without forcing a single hierarchy. At the same time, the model avoids ontological maximalism. Rather than adopting or extending a single comprehensive ontology, it uses modular patterns that can interoperate with existing standards where needed and remain silent where alignment would add complexity without policy value.

Crucially, representation is designed to distinguish between authoritative assertions and derived analytical statements. Authoritative data—such as identifiers, catalogue records, or rights-related facts—remains anchored to its source institution and is referenced with explicit provenance. Analytical representations, including inferred relationships or eligibility outcomes, are treated as derived artefacts that can be regenerated, revised, or withdrawn as methods evolve. This distinction enables reproducibility, auditability, and institutional trust, while ensuring that the data model remains adaptable to new policy questions and implementation contexts.

### Interoperability Mechanics

Interoperability in the *Open Music Observatory* is treated as a practical coordination problem rather than a purely semantic or technical one. Music-related data circulates across institutions with fundamentally different mandates, workflows, and legal responsibilities: collective management organisations, libraries, archives, broadcasters, platforms, and community initiatives often rely on overlapping data elements while assigning them different meanings and operational roles. Full harmonisation—whether through a single schema or a unified database—is neither feasible nor desirable under these conditions. Instead, interoperability is achieved through negotiated alignment across systems that remain institutionally autonomous.

Methodologically, this approach follows the logic of the *European Interoperability Framework* (EIF), which distinguishes legal, organisational, semantic, and technical layers. In the music domain, semantic alignment alone is insufficient unless it reflects organisational realities. For example, a library, a collective management organisation, and a digital distributor may all reference the same musical work or sound recording, yet do so for different purposes, under different legal regimes, and with different tolerance for uncertainty or incompleteness. Interoperability therefore requires making these differences explicit and bridgeable, rather than suppressing them. Semantic mappings are designed to respect divergent workflows while enabling shared reference where policy-relevant questions demand it.

At the technical level, interoperability is implemented through identifier reconciliation, controlled mappings between existing standards, and lightweight ontological patterns rather than comprehensive ontologies. The system is designed to interoperate selectively with DDEX-aligned industry metadata, ISRC-based recording identification, ISWC-based work identification used by CMOs[^27], and library- and archive-oriented standards such as *Dublin Core* and *Records in Contexts*[^28]. Crucially, these alignments do not imply that all participating actors must adopt the same vocabulary or level of granularity. Instead, they allow specific equivalences to be asserted, qualified, and traced with provenance, enabling downstream computation without forcing upstream conformity. The way we implemented ontological patterns of these music industry, library and archival standards is explained in the technical documentation of the Open Music Observatory[^29].

[^27]: *International Standard Musical Work Code* (ISWC). ISO 15707:2022 [@iso_iswc_2022], *International Standard Recording Code* (ISRC). {ISO} 3901:2019 [@iso_isrc_2019].

[^28]: In Slovakia, we placed a greater emphasis on libraries following the Dublin Core standards [@dublin_core_dcmi_2020], and in Hungary on archives [@RiC-CM_1_0]. Archives only start their transition to RiC from ISAD(G) and related standards, and backwards compatibility is a top priority.

[^29]: See [@omo_2024], particularly the [Appendix A — Data Model↗](https://downloads.reprex.nl/2025/open-music-observatory/annex-data-model.html).

A key design principle is the separation of authoritative data stewardship from interoperability and analysis layers. Authoritative sources—such as national libraries, CMOs, or archival institutions—remain systems of record, governed by their own legal and organisational constraints. Interoperability layers operate on references, mappings, and derived representations that can be regenerated, revised, or discarded without altering the underlying authority. This separation is essential both for governance-by-design and for compliance with data protection principles, as it allows internal evaluation and reconciliation without exposing personal or sensitive data beyond lawful contexts.

Finally, interoperability is treated as an ongoing process rather than a one-off achievement. As new actors join, policy questions evolve, or institutional practices change, mappings and alignments are expected to be revised. The *Open Music Observatory* therefore embeds interoperability mechanisms within transparent workflows that can be inspected, contested, and improved over time. This process-oriented view aligns with the comparison to the *CITF First Project* discussed earlier: both implementations demonstrate that durable interoperability emerges not from technical closure, but from sustained coordination between governance arrangements, organisational realities, and semantic design.

### Technical Publication and Scalability

Technical publication in the *Open Music Observatory* is explicitly separated from authoritative data stewardship. Systems of record—such as national libraries, collective management organisations, archives, or institutional catalogues—remain the sole authoritative holders of primary data.

The Observatory does not replicate or replace these systems. Instead, it operates through **derived, disposable publication layers** that are generated from authoritative sources for specific analytical and policy purposes. This distinction is central to both governance and scalability: authority is preserved upstream, while computation and analysis occur downstream on reproducible representations.

The primary publication mechanism relies on Wikibase as an integration and editing environment, combined with structured RDF exports for analysis and reuse. Wikibase provides a pragmatic balance between formal semantic structure and editorial accessibility, enabling institutions and expert communities to participate without requiring deep semantic-web specialisation. At the same time, it supports explicit provenance, qualifiers, and references, which are essential for auditability and institutional trust. Importantly, Wikibase functions here as a *publication and coordination layer*, not as a system of record. As we explain in the Open Music Observatory technical documentation and in our Green Paper, Wikidata is a quasi-standard setter, and hundreds of European cultural institutions, including national libraries, and the EU Publications Office moved to its open-source software system, Wikibase[^30].

[^30]: On heritage practices, see [@bianchini_beyond_2021, p210] and [@sardo_wikidata_2022, p297], which describe how VIAF, Wikidata, and Wikibase function as authority tools in libraries and archives.

For scalable dissemination and analysis, RDF exports are further transformed into efficient, queryable formats, including HDT (Header–Dictionary–Triples). HDT enables large graphs to be queried without full materialisation in memory or duplication across systems. This makes it particularly well suited to scenarios where graphs are regenerated periodically and treated as disposable analytical artefacts rather than permanent databases. Publication outputs can therefore be shared, archived, or recomputed without locking institutions into long-term storage or synchronisation commitments.

Scalability in this model is achieved through **reproducible regeneration**, not through accumulation. Rather than continuously appending new data to a growing central store, the Observatory regenerates its publication layers from authoritative sources using documented workflows. This approach supports versioning, comparison over time, and correction of earlier assumptions without technical debt. If a source dataset changes, a policy rule is refined, or a modelling decision is revised, the entire analytical layer can be rebuilt transparently.

This publication strategy aligns with European data governance principles that prioritise subsidiarity, proportionality, and non-extractive reuse. By avoiding central data hoarding, the Open Music Observatory remains compatible with institutional autonomy, data protection constraints, and evolving policy requirements. At the same time, it enables pan-European observability by ensuring that indicators and analytical results are reproducible, auditable, and scalable across jurisdictions and domains.

### Cross-Context Validation

The methodological choices underpinning the Open Music Observatory were not validated in isolation, but through sustained application across multiple institutional, cultural, and governance contexts. Validation, in this sense, does not mean optimisation within a single controlled environment, but resilience under variation: methods are considered robust insofar as they continue to function when confronted with different legal regimes, institutional capacities, cultural repertoires, and scales of operation.

The Slovak implementation provides a validation context characterised by relatively strong national institutions, clear cultural policy instruments, and established cooperation between ministries, collective management organisations, libraries, and sectoral bodies. In this setting, methods could be tested against concrete policy questions—such as local content measurement—under realistic governance and data protection constraints. The Hungarian replication introduced a different validation axis. Strong archival traditions, ethnomusicological collections, and divergent institutional histories required adaptation of modelling and governance assumptions, particularly in relation to archival provenance, contextualisation, and rights uncertainty. The fact that core methods remained applicable under these conditions supports their transferability beyond a single national model.

The *Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space* represents the most demanding validation context. Operating at subnational and community scale, often across borders and outside state-level cultural infrastructures, it tests whether the same methodological framework can function where institutional authority is fragmented or absent. Here, validation depends on the ability to support participatory curation, multilingual enrichment, and differentiated access without collapsing local epistemologies into national or European abstractions. The successful application of the same interoperability, provenance, and publication principles in this context demonstrates that methodological coherence does not require institutional uniformity.

Validation also occurred through exposure to supranational aggregation requirements. At the level of the Open Music Observatory’s central module, methods are evaluated not on their capacity for detailed curation, but on their ability to support comparison across countries, repertoires, and policy regimes without reintroducing identity-based categorisation or excessive harmonisation. This upward validation mirrors the role envisaged for European cultural infrastructures such as Europeana, the Culture Compass, and the future EU Culture Data Hub, where observability must coexist with subsidiarity.

Beyond deployment contexts, cross-context validation was reinforced through structured engagement with professional and expert communities. Consultations and presentations at forums such as IAML, IAMIC, CISAC, Wikimedia community meetings, and European data governance events provided iterative feedback on modelling assumptions, governance choices, and interoperability strategies. These exchanges served as peer validation mechanisms, ensuring that methods remained intelligible and credible to practitioners operating under different constraints.

Governance, federation, and data sovereignty issues were discussed in a broader cross-sectoral context at *Dataweek²⁴* in Leuven, within the framework of the *Big Data Value Association* and *Gaia-X*[^31]. Presenting the *Open Music Observatory* and its national modules as an example of a European music dataspace allowed the methodological approach to be evaluated against emerging governance expectations for federated data infrastructures, including principles of subsidiarity, non-extractive reuse, and institutional autonomy. Feedback from this forum directly informed the articulation of the federated data-sharing model described in the present paper.

[^31]: Jun 5, 2024, [Dataweek²⁴](https://reprex.nl/event/2024-06-05_dataweek_leuven/), Leuven, Belgium.

Our work was presented in the Technology sessions of the *Wikimedia CEE Meeting 2024* (Istanbul) and the *Wikimedia CEE Meeting 2025* (Thessaloniki), as well as at *Wikidata Conf 2025* (online) [@antal_wikimedia_cee_2024; @wikimuseum_2025; @antal_wikidata_conf_2025]. These forums provided a practical testbed for validating modelling choices, editorial workflows, and governance assumptions against large-scale, community-maintained knowledge infrastructures.

Taken together, these validation contexts demonstrate that the methodological framework of the *Open Music Observatory* is neither tailored to a single institutional configuration nor abstracted away from practice. Its robustness derives from being tested across national, subnational, community, and supranational settings, and from remaining adaptable without losing analytical coherence. This capacity for cross-context operation is essential if music observability is to function as a credible forerunner for wider European cultural data infrastructures.

Through this engagement, we established working relationships with several national Wikimedia chapters and with the Wikidata and Abstract Wikipedia teams, and participated in the *Wikidata Ontology Cleanup Task Force* and the *Wikidata Mereology Task Force*. This involvement helped align our ontological patterns, identifier practices, and documentation strategies with broader open knowledge standards, while also ensuring that our approach to provenance, uncertainty, and institutional responsibility remains compatible with community-driven curation environments.

## Diversity Goals Without Exposure of Sensitive Data {#sec-sensitive-data}

The implementation of the **Slovak Comprehensive Music Database** (available at [https://hudobnadatabaza.sk/](https://hudobnadatabaza.sk/en/)), HUNDB (available at ), the **Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space** (available at [https://finnougric.net/](https://finnougric.net/en/)) coincided with a broader shift in European policy thinking on data governance, artificial intelligence, and cultural infrastructures. Over the past decade, it has become increasingly clear that Europe’s capacity to pursue cultural, social, and economic objectives in the digital domain depends less on isolated regulatory instruments and more on the availability of trustworthy, interoperable data infrastructures. This shift is reflected in the *European Data Strategy*, the *Data Governance Act*[^32], and the growing emphasis on sectoral data spaces as instruments of public policy.

[^32]: *Regulation (EU) 2022/868 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2022 on European data governance and amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1724* (Data Governance Act) [@regulation_dga_2022_868]

In the cultural and creative sectors, this transformation has been driven in part by the rapid platformisation of music distribution and discovery. Recommendation systems, analytics pipelines, and increasingly generative AI models now mediate access to cultural content at a global scale. These systems rely on metadata that is often incomplete, inconsistent, or governed by commercial incentives that do not align with public-interest objectives. As a result, cultural policy goals—such as diversity, linguistic plurality, gender balance, or local content promotion—are difficult to articulate, let alone enforce, within algorithmic environments dominated by non-European actors.

### The Diversity & Circulation Aspects of European Music Policy

Against this backdrop, diversity quotas and local content regulations can no longer be understood as standalone cultural policy tools. Instead, they function as **stress tests** for Europe’s data governance ambitions. If a policy goal cannot be expressed in machine-readable terms, evaluated using auditable data sources, and implemented without violating fundamental rights, it risks becoming symbolic rather than effective. The monitoring and enforcement gaps identified in earlier quota systems thus foreshadowed a more general problem: the absence of shared reference infrastructures capable of mediating between policy intent, data protection law, and algorithmic practice.

European institutions have increasingly recognised this challenge. Rather than advocating for centralised databases or uniform metadata schemas, recent policy documents emphasise **federation, interoperability, and governance-by-design**. Data spaces are envisaged as socio-technical arrangements in which multiple actors retain control over their data, while agreeing on shared semantics, interfaces, and rules of engagement. This approach is particularly well suited to the cultural sector, where data is distributed across public institutions, collective management organisations, private platforms, archives, libraries, and community initiatives, each operating under different legal and ethical constraints.

Within this framework, the principle of subsidiarity acquires renewed significance. Cultural identity, heritage, and creative production are deeply contextual and cannot be meaningfully governed through purely centralised mechanisms. At the same time, national solutions alone are insufficient in a digital environment characterised by cross-border circulation, global platforms, and transnational audiences. European data governance therefore requires **multi-level infrastructures** that operate simultaneously at community, national, and supra-national scales, without collapsing these levels into a single point of control.

A defining feature of the Slovak Comprehensive Music Database is the strict separation between **internal evaluation** and **external disclosure**. While the system may internally process attributes that are relevant for diversity or local content criteria, it exposes only binary or aggregated outcomes. At the level of the recording, a track is reported as meeting or not meeting a quota requirement, without revealing which contributor, which personal attribute, or which specific criterion triggered eligibility.

This separation is central to the viability of diversity-aware cultural policy under European legal and ethical constraints. It operationalises the principle of data minimisation by ensuring that only the information necessary for editorial, regulatory, or analytical purposes is disclosed. At the same time, it preserves the ability to evaluate complex quota definitions that depend on personal attributes which cannot lawfully or ethically be exposed.

Implementing this distinction requires more than a technical design choice. It is precisely the challenge addressed by **legal, organisational, and semantic alignment** under the European Interoperability Framework. The system must be able to lawfully access authoritative data sources, design an organisational workflow that produces a determinate evaluative outcome, and communicate that outcome back into a shared data space using semantics that can be consistently interpreted by diverse actors, including broadcasters, curators, researchers, and media authorities.

In the Slovak context, this workflow is deeply intertwined with rights management. The national data sharing space is organised around SOZA, the collective management organisation with legal competence to identify musical works and connect them to living rightsholders and their heirs. Personal characteristics of composers—such as place of birth, nationality, residence, or ethnicity—are strictly protected under the *General Data Protection Regulation* and are not accessible for disclosure. As a result, while the evaluative logic is conceptually straightforward, its practical implementation is necessarily mediated by institutional trust and competence.

At a high level, the internal evaluation proceeds through a sequence of controlled matches. A sound recording is identified and linked to the musical work it embodies; the work is associated with its composer or composers; and the system evaluates whether any of the relevant personal or work-level characteristics satisfy the applicable quota definition. If at least one criterion is met, the recording is marked as eligible for the purposes of the local content quota. Crucially, the reason for eligibility is never exposed. A composition may qualify because the composer was born in Slovakia, because the composer resides there, or because the lyrics are written in the Slovak language. If any of these conditions are satisfied, all recordings of works by that composer—including co-authored works—are treated as eligible, without disclosing which condition applied.

The result of this internal evaluation is exposed through a simple property at the level of the recording. For example, a recording may be labelled as heritage of Slovakia when it qualifies under the national quota, or as heritage of Slovaks when eligibility is based on linguistic intelligibility for Slovak speakers as an ethnolinguistic group. This modelling choice deliberately abstracts away from individual identity attributes while retaining policy-relevant meaning. It allows quota evaluation to operate at the level of cultural artefacts rather than persons.

Language of lyrics occupies a particular position within this framework. Unlike personal attributes, language is an audible and editorially relevant characteristic of a recording, yet it remains culturally mediated rather than strictly objective. In SKCMDb, lyrics are treated as Slovak when they are intelligible to a native Slovak speaker, even if they are performed in dialectal or archaic forms, as is common in folk traditions. Such determinations may be established by native-speaker curators, performers, or composers. This approach recognises linguistic variation without essentialising identity or excluding historically rooted forms of expression.

The is heritage of property used to express these outcomes is defined in the ECCCH *Heritage Digital Twin Ontology*[^33], which subclasses CIDOC CRM and is widely used in museum and heritage contexts. In SKCMDb, this property—also used under the alias local to—represents a form of community stewardship governed primarily by ethical frameworks such as CARE, rather than by legal entitlement alone. In the Hungarian replication, the same property is used to refer not only to Hungarians as a national group, but also to linguistically distinct communities such as Székely or Moldavian Hungarian speakers in present-day Romania. A Szekler folk song may thus be treated as part of the Hungarian national quota for policy purposes, while retaining a more precise ethnolinguistic designation for ethnomusicological analysis.

[^33]: *Heritage Digital Twin Ontology (HDTO) -- First Draft* [@echoes_hdto_2025]

The same abstraction is applied at the level of nation-states. A recording is treated as heritage of or local to Slovakia or Hungary if it meets the respective national quota regulations. This modelling choice enables the computation of statistical indicators—such as the proportion of locally relevant repertoire in charts or playlists—without exposing personal data or identity categories. It also allows the same underlying evaluation logic to support multiple policy objectives, including radio and television quotas, festival programming diversity, and international initiatives such as gender equality pledges.

It is important to note that the impact of the General Data Protection Regulation on the cultural heritage, music, and digital humanities sectors extended far beyond the specific context of diversity quotas. While GDPR contains differentiated provisions for libraries, archives, and other GLAM institutions, its introduction nevertheless came as a structural shock to the sector. Long-standing practices of metadata publication, authority sharing, and collaborative documentation—often developed in good faith and under earlier legal regimes—suddenly became legally ambiguous or non-compliant. This applies in particular to retroactively affected archival materials and to cross-institutional authority initiatives, such as shared name files or federated registries, which rely on the controlled exchange of personal data.

Within this context, the architecture developed for SKCMDb supports not only policy evaluation, but also institutional compliance and remediation. By enabling the lawful use of GDPR-protected data within trusted environments to correctly link agents to archival, library, museum, and rights registry holdings, the system helps participating institutions to repair metadata, clarify authorship and neighbouring rights relationships, and address potential moral rights issues. Crucially, this work remains internal to competent institutions, while its outcomes—such as corrected links, clarified work–recording relationships, or eligibility evaluations—can be safely exposed at an abstracted level.

In this sense, the approach taken here does not merely limit disclosure to avoid legal risk. It creates the conditions under which heritage institutions may, after careful analysis, increase the educational, research, or public visibility of their holdings in a legally and ethically defensible manner. Rather than treating GDPR as an external obstacle to cultural data work, the system incorporates it as a design constraint that, when properly addressed, enables more responsible sharing, clearer rights attribution, and more sustainable interoperability across the music and heritage sectors.

By design, this approach prevents the system from becoming a tool for profiling or surveillance. Editors and analysts receive determinate, interpretable results, while the underlying personal data remains protected within competent institutions. In this way, diversity goals are operationalised not through the exposure of identity, but through the careful design of evaluative workflows that respect legal constraints, ethical commitments, and the complex social realities of European cultural production.

From a policy perspective, the *Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space* functions as a subsidiarity and epistemic-justice stress test for European data governance concepts. Unlike the Slovak or Hungarian cases, it operates largely outside state-scale cultural infrastructures and engages communities whose heritage has historically been documented, classified, and interpreted through external—often post-imperial—institutional frameworks. This makes it particularly relevant for assessing whether European principles such as federation, non-extractive reuse, governance-by-design, and respect for cultural and linguistic diversity can be operationalised in low-scale cultural ecosystems.

![See our original poster in Digital Humanities in the Nordic and Baltic Countries (DHNB 2025), Tartu, 5-7 March 2025, and the subsequent paper in the following footnote.](png/fuds/fudss_tartu_slide_03.PNG){fig-align="center"}

At the same time, the turn toward Finno-Ugric heritage was motivated by a pragmatic methodological consideration. While the Slovak and Hungarian implementations aimed for broad coverage across hundreds of thousands of works and recordings, such scale makes it difficult to observe, test, and refine governance and modelling assumptions in a controlled manner. By contrast, Livonian and related Finno-Ugric repertoires can be described using hundreds rather than hundreds of thousands of items. This reduced scale enables exhaustive modelling, close inspection of provenance and rights statements, and direct community engagement, providing a conceptually tractable environment in which architectural and governance choices can be stress-tested before being applied to larger national or pan-European systems[^34].

[^34]: See our accepted paper in preprint: *Federating Open Knowledge through Wikibase: The Case of The Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space* and the original poster presentation *A Finno-Ugric Data Sharing Space* [@fudss_preprint; @finnougric_2025]

In this sense, the Finno-Ugric module is neither peripheral nor exceptional. It functions as a *conceptual*and *methodological laboratory* for European data-space design, demonstrating how principles developed under conditions of maximal institutional fragmentation and linguistic diversity can inform the construction of scalable, trustworthy infrastructures in more complex cultural ecosystems. By enabling communities to participate in the repair, contextualisation, and reuse of authoritative cultural data without recentralising control, the module aligns European data-space logic with commitments to non-discrimination, proportionality, and fundamental cultural rights.

## Application Layers and System Architecture {#sec-application}

The layered system architecture of SKCMDb is a direct consequence of the federated governance model described in the preceding sections. The separation between data stewardship, interoperability, public access, and analysis is not merely a technical design choice, but an operationalisation of institutional competence, legal responsibility, and subsidiarity. In particular, it reflects the need to support policy-relevant evaluation and analytical reuse while ensuring that sensitive data remains under the control of the institutions legally entitled to process it.

At the foundation of the architecture is a **private or trusted layer**, operated by institutions with formal legal competence over authoritative data. In the Slovak case, this layer is anchored in the systems of the collective management organisation SOZA and, where relevant, other trusted institutional partners. This layer contains detailed information on musical works, rightsholders, and personal attributes that may be necessary for internal evaluation, rights clearance, or metadata repair, but which are protected under data protection law. Access to this layer is governed by contractual, legal, and organisational safeguards, reflecting the governance arrangements established through the national Memorandum of Understanding described in @sec-policy. Its contents are never exposed directly to external users or applications.

Behind the scenes, the trusted private layer performs metadata reconciliation, linking, and repair tasks using AI-assisted workflows within a data sharing space built on a knowledge graph. This model was chosen because it preserves full human control over both data sharing and inference: institutions retain authority over what data is processed and disclosed, while any inferred relationships—such as links between a musical work and its recorded fixations for royalty allocation—remain transparent, traceable, and auditable. By embedding AI within a governed knowledge graph rather than opaque pipelines, the architecture ensures that automation supports, rather than replaces, institutional responsibility, legal accountability, and human oversight[^35].

The following subsection documents how the private or trusted layer of the observatory was implemented in practice in the Slovak pilot. Rather than proposing a general legal model, it describes the concrete data protection reasoning, lawful bases, safeguards, and governance mechanisms adopted by SOZA and its partners to enable authority control and controlled data sharing in compliance with EU data protection law. It is relatively straightforward to replicate in another EU country, because GDPR applies directly in the entire European Union. Outside of the European Union, significant changes may be necessary.

### Public-private governance and data protection

Prior to the actual establishment of the private or trusted layer as the first layer, data protection challenges needed to be addressed. SOZA collects and processes the personal data of its members for the purposes of collective management. Such collection and processing are based on consent. Although the concept of “collective management” as a lawful basis is sufficiently broad, for reasons of transparency and legal certainty SOZA considered it necessary to identify a new lawful basis for the further processing of personal data within the context of the SKCMDb.

Initially, SOZA prepared a consent-based participation scheme. However, due to the large number of members and the low response rate to participation requests, it became necessary to identify an alternative lawful basis for the intended processing. Consequently, a legitimate interest was selected as the lawful basis for further processing. In this context, a legitimate interest assessment, in the form of **a balancing test**, was required and prepared.

The core of this balancing test[^36] consisted of assessing the potential impact of further processing of personal data on the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, namely SOZA’s members. If the potential impact on these rights and freedoms were to override SOZA’s legitimate interest, legitimate interest could not serve as a lawful basis for the intended further processing.

[^36]: The balancing test was conducted in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, short: GDPR), which permits the processing of personal data where it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller, provided that such interests are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. [@gdpr_2016_679]

The personal data held by SOZA that is crucial for the proper functioning and establishment of the SKCMDb was divided into two groups, depending on whether the data would be made publicly accessible or accessible upon request to selected subjects. The categories of personal data concerned include name, surname, pseudonym, date of birth, place of permanent residence, and sex. Name, surname, and pseudonym are made publicly accessible, while date of birth, place of permanent residence, and sex are accessible upon request to selected subjects. This division of personal data into two tiers of access—public and upon request—plays a significant role in the management and protection of personal data. In this context, maintaining control over the data and its extraction is crucial for SOZA.

Based on these tiers of access, users of the SKCMDb can also be divided into two groups: data contributors and data extractors. Data contributors provide personal data, thereby contributing to the content of the SKCMDb and improving its quality. Data extractors exclusively extract data from the SKCMDb, either from the publicly available layer or from the upon-request layer. It should be noted, however, that data contributors also act as data extractors with respect to each other’s data.

Data contributors include SOZA, HC, HF, and SNK, all of which are signatories to the *second* *Memorandum of Understanding* with Reprex, the technical data and knowledge processor is concluded, among other purposes, to enable controlled and legally sound data sharing[^37]. This structure is very similar to the first project of the Copyright Infrastructure Task Force introduced in @sec-citf-first-project.

[^37]: *Memorandum o porozumení vo vzťahu k Slovenskej súhrnnej hudobnej database -* \[Memorandum of Understanding in relation to the Slovak Comprehensive Music Database\] (SOZA, Hudobné centrum, Slovenská národný knižnica, Hudobný fond and Reprex)

Data extractors include all data contributors, as well as various music streaming platforms, online knowledge databases, encyclopaedias, and similar services.

SOZA’s legitimate interest was identified as including the following objectives:

-    improving and streamlining the performance of collective rights management carried out by SOZA for its members;

-    increasing the accuracy and availability of information about the musical works of SOZA’s members;

-    promoting Slovak music, musical works, musical recordings, and knowledge about Slovak music by making them more easily accessible and searchable; and

-    promoting authors of musical works and music publishers represented by SOZA.

In light of the above, and in the context of the establishment of the SKCMDb, the potential benefits of further processing of personal data were assessed as not overriding SOZA’s legitimate interest. Accordingly, legitimate interest could be employed as a lawful basis for the intended further processing of personal data.

As the lawful basis for further processing is legitimate interest rather than consent, an opt-out option must be provided to data subjects, namely SOZA’s members. Notifications of the planned further processing of personal data, including information about the opt-out option, were distributed to data subjects via SOZA’s internal user interface, an email newsletter, and a permanent notification on SOZA’s website. The opt-out can be exercised by sending an email to SOZA’s Data Protection Officer. In this context, the opt-out option serves as an important mechanism for protecting the rights and freedoms of data subjects.

In connection with the processing of personal data, cooperation with an external data processor was established. The external data processor was selected based on its technical expertise, trustworthiness, and implementation of appropriate data protection and security measures. The cooperation is governed by an agreement on the processing of personal data, which serves as the legal basis for the relationship and defines the mutual rights and obligations of the parties. The agreement also imposes obligations relating to confidentiality, security, and data protection. The SKCMDb is continuously updated and subject to ongoing technical and security supervision, ensuring compliance with EU data protection regulations and resulting in a fully functional private or trusted layer.

Above this sits an **intermediate interoperability layer**, which functions as a controlled interface between trusted data holders and the wider data sharing space. In the SKCMDb implementation, this role is fulfilled by a SPARQL endpoint implemented using Apache Jena Fuseki. This layer hosts derived RDF graphs generated from authoritative sources and refreshed on a regular basis. Crucially, these graphs are treated as reproducible publication artefacts rather than systems of record. They contain only non-personal data and outcome-level properties resulting from internal evaluation, such as eligibility flags or heritage associations. In this way, the interoperability layer translates institutionally governed microdata into a form that can circulate safely across organisational and national boundaries without exposing sensitive underlying information.

### Public Access Layer

The **public access layer** builds on this interoperability interface to support exploration, navigation, and reuse by a broader audience. In several modules of the Open Music Observatory ecosystem, including the Slovak implementation, this layer is realised through a Sampo semantic browser.

The Sampo Semantic Browser is implemented using the Sampo-UI framework, a full-stack JavaScript framework for developing semantic portal user interfaces. These interfaces are designed primarily for cultural heritage, research, and policy contexts[^38], and support exploratory access to graph-based data through faceted search and multiple analytical perspectives. In the observatory, this layer allows users to browse repertoires, explore relationships between works, recordings, agents, and institutions, and apply faceted filters based exclusively on non-sensitive attributes.

[^38]: Sampo-UI was developed by the Semantic Computing Research Group (SeCo) at Aalto University in collaboration with the Helsinki Centre for Digital Humanities (HELDIG). The framework has been applied in numerous national and international semantic portals in the cultural heritage and digital humanities domains. We are grateful to the Sampo team for their openness, documentation, and constructive feedback during the design of the observatory’s semantic browsing layer. More information: *Sampo-UI: A Full Stack JavaScript Framework for Developing Semantic Portal User Interfaces* [@ikkala_sampo_ui]

Our use of Sampo-UI benefited substantially from guidance and feedback provided by the Sampo development team. In particular, discussions during a workshop on presenting Finno-Ugric cultural data at the *Digital Humanities in the Nordic and Baltic Countries* (DHNB) 2025 conference in Tartu helped clarify design choices and interaction patterns for semantic browsing in a multilingual and cross-institutional context. From a governance perspective, the semantic browser layer supports transparency and public value, as articulated in the Slovak Memorandum of Understanding, while remaining clearly separated from any processing of personal data and from the private or trusted layers of the observatory architecture.

These interfaces are designed primarily for cultural heritage, research, and policy conte. They allow users to browse repertoires, explore relationships between works and recordings, and apply faceted filters based on non-sensitive attributes. From a governance perspective, this layer embodies the commitment to transparency and public value articulated in the Slovak MoU, while remaining firmly decoupled from any processing of personal data.

The **analytical layer** provides tools for computation, aggregation, and visualisation, and is explicitly constrained to operate on the same outcome-level data exposed through the interoperability layer. In the Slovak case, this includes computational notebooks built in R and applications built with Shiny, which enable editors, analysts, or researchers to upload playlists or chart data and compute diversity or local-content indicators based on matches against the SKCMDb graph. These analytical tools do not require, and do not permit, direct access to trusted institutional data. Their design reflects the separation between internal evaluation and external use described in @sec-sensitive-data ensuring that policy-relevant analysis can be performed without expanding the circle of access to protected data.

This layered architecture also enables replication across jurisdictions and institutional contexts. A similar configuration can be deployed elsewhere by identifying appropriate data stewards for the trusted layer, exposing derived graphs through a standardised interoperability interface, and reusing or adapting existing public and analytical applications. Because the analytical logic operates on outcome-level properties rather than raw personal data, the same tools can be reused across national implementations even where underlying legal regimes, institutional arrangements, or data sources differ. This was precisely the case in the Hungarian implementation, where a bottom-up governance model required tighter institutional boundaries, and in the Finno-Ugric data spaces, where trusted layers are distributed across NGOs and regional GLAM institutions rather than central authorities.

Importantly, the architecture also supports asymmetry between modules. Not all implementations are required to expose the same interfaces or support identical analytical workflows. In contexts where statistical monitoring is a priority, such as national broadcast quotas, the analytical layer may focus on time-series aggregation and indicator computation. In archival or ethnomusicological contexts, by contrast, public interfaces and analytical tools may prioritise qualitative exploration, provenance tracing, or competence questions that are not immediately reducible to numerical indicators. The architecture accommodates these differences without fragmentation because all layers remain anchored in shared semantic models and governance principles.

By deriving its technical structure from governance and policy constraints rather than imposing them retroactively, the SKCMDb architecture ensures that diversity-aware cultural policy objectives can be supported without compromising data protection, institutional autonomy, or ethical commitments. At the same time, it creates a clear and auditable pathway from authoritative microdata to aggregated indicators. This makes it possible to demonstrate the system’s capabilities through concrete empirical applications. The following section presents such an application, applying the SKCMDb infrastructure to the computation of local content indicators derived from official Slovak music charts.

## Case Study: Computing Local Content Indicators from Official Charts {#sec-case-study}

This section presents an empirical application of the SKCMDb infrastructure to demonstrate how diversity- and locality-related indicators can be computed reproducibly, lawfully, and without exposing sensitive personal data. The case study applies the methodological, governance, and architectural principles developed in the preceding sections to an authoritative, real-world dataset: the official Slovak music charts. Its purpose is not to evaluate individual actors or enforce compliance, but to show how a shared reference infrastructure can support informed, voluntary, and legally robust engagement with cultural policy objectives.

### Data sources and scope {#sec-case-study-data-source}

The empirical material for this case study consists of **156 consecutive weeks of the official Slovak Top 50 charts**, covering a three-year observation period. The charts were provided directly by **IFPI ČR/SR**, the recognised owner and administrator of the official Slovak charts. This ensures that the dataset reflects the repertoire actually used for public reporting, industry benchmarking, and broader discussion of music consumption in Slovakia.

All charting entries across the observation period were ingested into the Slovak Comprehensive Music Database. Rather than sampling or pre-filtering the data, the case study deliberately includes the full set of charting recordings. This choice serves two purposes: it demonstrates the scalability of the approach, and it avoids biases that could be introduced through selective inclusion or editorial filtering.

### Rationale for the use of official charts as a neutral reference corpus

The choice of official music charts as the empirical basis for this case study was deliberate and reflects both legal and institutional considerations identified during the feasibility phase. In Slovakia, local content regulations apply directly to radio broadcasters, who are legally required to meet minimum quotas for domestic repertoire. At the same time, consultations conducted as part of the Listen Local feasibility study—funded by the Slovak Arts Council and later extended within the OpenMusE project supported by the European Commission—revealed a recurring concern among broadcasters: while they are subject to regulatory obligations, they have received limited institutional support to monitor compliance in a reliable, consistent, and legally safe manner.

From the perspective of editors, the “Slovakness” of a recording is often not directly observable. Audible language, artist name, or registration metadata may provide partial signals, but they are insufficient to determine eligibility under the full legal definition of the quota. This opacity creates uncertainty and can encourage overly cautious programming strategies that privilege already well-established repertoire, undermining the intended policy goals of diversity, renewal, and inclusion.

One of the core aims of the feasibility work, and of SKCMDb more broadly, was therefore to provide tools that **support compliance rather than enforce it**. The objective is to lower the informational and organisational burden on editors and curators, enabling them to make informed decisions without exposing personal data or assuming regulatory authority. This support-oriented approach extends beyond licensed broadcasters. Local bars, hotels, cultural venues, and independent playlist curators—many of whom are not formally subject to quota obligations—may nevertheless wish to contribute voluntarily to local cultural ecosystems. In cities such as Košice, for example, there is reason to believe that many venues would be willing to give greater visibility to local artists if they could be confident that public performance fees and cultural attention flow back into the local music community.

For these reasons, the case study deliberately avoids analysing the playlists or programming decisions of individual radio stations. Instead, it uses the official Slovak charts as a **neutral reference corpus**. The charts are widely recognised, industry-authoritative, and relevant to all broadcasters, yet they do not belong to any single station. This choice avoids any implication of monitoring or evaluating specific actors, while still allowing the demonstration of how diversity and locality indicators can be computed from shared, publicly acknowledged reference data.

By grounding the empirical application in a neutral dataset, the case study positions SKCMDb as a common infrastructure serving the entire ecosystem. It demonstrates how authoritative reference data can be transformed into policy-relevant indicators that are usable by broadcasters, venues, and curators alike—without creating new asymmetries of power or shifting regulatory responsibilities onto the data infrastructure itself.

### Microdata layer: recordings and works {#case-study-microdata}

Each chart entry was first resolved to a **sound recording**, identified by standard industry identifiers where available (such as ISRC), complemented by platform identifiers and curated matches where necessary. Recordings were then linked to the **musical works** they embody. This step is essential, as eligibility for local content quotas in Slovakia depends in part on attributes of the composer, which are properties of the work rather than of the recording or the performer.

Within SKCMDb, both recordings and works are represented as Wikibase items. In methodological terms, each item functions as a structured dataset consisting of statements, qualifiers, and provenance information. This representation allows the system to accommodate uncertainty, multiple assertions, and evolving knowledge, while maintaining traceability and institutional accountability.

The matching process relies on authoritative sources mediated through trusted institutional partners, particularly collective management organisations. Where automated matching is possible, explicit identifiers are preferred; where human curation is required, decisions are recorded with provenance. This conservative approach reflects the methodological stance articulated earlier: correctness and accountability take precedence over maximal coverage.

### Internal evaluation and indicator logic

For the purposes of this case study, two indicators were defined in line with Slovak regulatory and editorial practice:

1.  **Slovak-language share**, indicating whether a recording qualifies based on the intelligibility of its lyrics for Slovak speakers.

2.  **Slovak-origin share**, indicating whether a recording qualifies based on the eligibility of its composer or composers under national criteria, such as residence or other legally recognised connections.

The internal evaluation logic follows the principles described in Section 5. For each recording, the system evaluates whether any of the applicable criteria are met. If at least one criterion applies, the recording is marked as eligible. Crucially, the system does not record or expose which specific criterion triggered eligibility, nor which individual contributor satisfied it. The outcome is expressed solely as an artefact-level property of the recording.

This logic allows complex, legally constrained definitions of locality to be operationalised without exposing personal data or identity categories. It also ensures consistency across recordings by the same composer, including co-authored works, while avoiding person-level disclosure.

### Aggregation and observatory-level representation

Eligibility outcomes were aggregated at two temporal resolutions: **weekly**, corresponding to individual chart publications, and **annual**, corresponding to calendar-year summaries. For each period, the proportion of chart entries qualifying under the Slovak-language and Slovak-origin indicators was computed.

These aggregated results were then expressed as **statistical data cubes** within the central modules of the Open Music Observatory. Time was modelled explicitly as a dimension, with measured values representing the respective shares. By lifting the results from item-level evaluations into a statistical representation, the case study demonstrates how national-level reference data can contribute to supra-national observatory functions without transferring underlying microdata or sensitive attributes.

Importantly, the observatory-level representation contains no information that would allow the reconstruction of personal characteristics or editorial decisions at the level of individual works or contributors. What circulates upward is a set of interpretable indicators, not the data used to compute them.

### Interpretation limits and policy relevance

The purpose of this case study is not to assess compliance by individual broadcasters, nor to evaluate the effectiveness of Slovak cultural policy. The indicators presented are **descriptive**, not normative, and they do not imply causality. Their function is to demonstrate that diversity- and locality-related metrics can be computed in a manner that is auditable, reproducible, and compatible with European data protection and non-discrimination principles.

From a policy perspective, the case study illustrates how authoritative industry data, rights-mediated evaluation, and federated data governance can be combined to support evidence-informed discussion without creating new surveillance or enforcement mechanisms. From a methodological perspective, it shows that the same infrastructure can support both fine-grained microdata curation and high-level statistical aggregation, depending on the level at which questions are asked.

In this sense, the charts analysis serves as a **proof of implementation** rather than as a standalone analytical result. It demonstrates that the SKCMDb architecture is capable of translating abstract policy criteria into computable indicators, while preserving institutional autonomy, protecting sensitive data, and remaining interoperable within a European data space.

## Discussion and Outlook {#sec-outlook}

This paper set out to address a persistent gap between the ambitions of diversity-oriented cultural policy and the practical realities of its implementation in contemporary music ecosystems. Through the development and empirical demonstration of the *Slovak Comprehensive Music Database*, embedded within the Open Music Observatory framework, we have shown that this gap is not primarily a matter of regulatory design or editorial goodwill, but of missing data infrastructures capable of translating policy criteria into computable, ethically governed outcomes.

A central contribution of this work lies in reframing local content quotas and diversity targets as information design problems rather than enforcement challenges. By distinguishing clearly between cultural artefacts and persons, and by separating internal evaluation from external disclosure, the SKCMDb approach demonstrates that complex eligibility rules can be operationalised without exposing sensitive personal data or violating principles of non-discrimination. This reframing is particularly important in the European context, where cultural policy objectives must coexist with strong data protection regimes and fundamental rights protections.

The case study based on official Slovak music charts illustrates how this approach functions in practice. By relying on an authoritative, neutral reference corpus, the analysis avoids the pitfalls of monitoring or evaluating individual broadcasters, while still demonstrating how policy-relevant indicators can be computed reproducibly and transparently. The resulting indicators are not instruments of enforcement, but shared points of reference that can support voluntary compliance, editorial reflection, and evidence-informed discussion across the music ecosystem. In this sense, the charts analysis serves as a proof of implementation rather than a policy verdict.

At the same time, the broader architecture of SKCMDb highlights the importance of subsidiarity and pluralism in cultural data governance. The Slovak and Hungarian implementations, together with the Livonian and Karelian community-curated databases, demonstrate that methodological coherence does not require uniform analytical outputs. National broadcast monitoring, ethnomusicological competence questions, and community heritage stewardship can coexist within a shared framework, provided that governance, semantics, and responsibilities are clearly articulated. This pluralistic design reflects both the diversity of European cultural production and the institutional realities of the cultural sector.

Several limitations of the present work should be acknowledged. First, the indicators demonstrated here are necessarily reductive abstractions of complex cultural phenomena. They do not capture qualitative dimensions of musical innovation, artistic value, or audience engagement, nor do they address causal relationships between policy interventions and cultural outcomes. Second, the reliance on authoritative institutional data implies a dependency on existing infrastructures, which may vary in completeness and accessibility across countries and sectors. Finally, while the approach is designed to be extensible, its successful replication depends on the willingness of competent institutions to engage in shared governance and to invest in sustainable data stewardship. Despite these limitations, the implications of this work extend beyond the immediate Slovak context. The methodological and architectural principles outlined here are applicable to other cultural domains and policy areas in which diversity, representation, and fairness intersect with large-scale data processing. In particular, they offer a pathway for integrating cultural policy objectives into algorithmic environments—such as recommender systems and analytics platforms—without reproducing the extractive or surveillance-oriented practices often associated with global digital platforms.

Looking forward, this work contributes to the ongoing development of the Open Music Observatory as a prototype for a future European Music Observatory. Its diversity pillar, of which SKCMDb constitutes a substantial part, demonstrates how European values of data governance—subsidiarity, proportionality, data sovereignty, and ethical stewardship—can be operationalised in practice. The inclusion of Finno-Ugric musical heritage, extending beyond the geographical boundaries of Europe, further underscores that “European” in this context denotes a governance philosophy rather than a territorial limitation. Future research and development efforts will focus on expanding the range of indicators, refining rights-aware modelling, and exploring integrations with emerging AI governance frameworks. In doing so, the aim is not to replace editorial judgement or cultural expertise, but to augment them with infrastructures that make diversity goals computable, auditable, and actionable under real-world conditions. By treating cultural policy as a shared infrastructural challenge rather than a zero-sum regulatory contest, the approach presented here offers a constructive path toward more inclusive, resilient, and transparent cultural ecosystems in Europe and beyond.

## Annex A: Data Used

### Personal Data {.unnumbered}

Personal data was received in eight Excel files based on explicit GDPR consent. These files are not available directly, but the persons' data was worked into the Slovak Comprehensive Music Database.

Some of this personal data is also available on an opt-out basis to support SOZA's collective rights management activities, and reduce the cost and potential error rate of distributing the artist's royalties. The opt-out data is handled by a separate agreement between SOZA and Reprex.

Generally, names are treated in two ways: in the graph database, they are used as a *label* of the graph node that represents the artist; and either as a full name, or as given and surname, they are added separately to this graph.

The *label* is always a preferred name, whenever possible, based on our MoU with the Slovak national library, we use the preferred name of SNK's authority file. In the alias field, we collect known surface forms of the name to match music service or bibliographical records.

For example, the 19th century composer's name is often spelled as *Franz Liszt*, *Liszt Ferencz* (contemporary 19th century spelling)or *Liszt Ferenc*, and as *Liszt, F*. Liszt was one of the most famous musicians of the Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy, and he lived and worked in the current territory of the Slovak Republic, Hungary, and Austria. According to the customs of Austria-Hungary, he used his name in a German and Austrian form.

Currently, the Slovak national authority files and the German authority files use *Liszt, Franz* as the preferred name. The Hungarian, Estonian, Czech, and Lithuanian national systems prefer the Hungarian *Liszt, Ferenc* version. The Russian national library uses *Liszt, F*, or its Cyrillic transliteration.

In the 21 century, it is less usual to have translated given names, however, it remains a fact that Hungarian names, including minority Hungarian names in Slovakia are following the Eastern name order: *Kurtág Ferenc*, which would be *Ferenc Kurtág* in the Western name order, and libraries in Hungary and most of the world would use the *Kurtág, Ferenc* unambiguous ordering.

We see two modelling solutions for this problem, explicitly writing in *Ferenc* as a given name, and indicating that its historical form is *Ferencz* and historically it was often translated to *Franz*, and treat *Liszt* as a surname. This aligns most with the generally used FOAF ontology.

The other solution, which may replace or complement the previous solution is the use of several labels and aliases. Our system has labels for every language, therefore, in the Slovak interface, the main label is *Liszt, Franz,* while in the Hungarian it is *Liszt, Ferenc.*

In this case, for interoperability between Slovak and Hungarian sources, we use *Liszt, Franz* as a preferred label on the Slovak interface, and *Liszt, Ferenc* as an alias (alternative name); in the Hungarian language interface, we do the opposite. In ontological terms, *"Liszt, Franz"\@sk* is the rdfs:label for Slovak language use and *"Liszt, Ferenc"\@hu* is the rdfs:label for Hungarian language use.

Last but not least, artists may chose to detach their private and public personas and use pseudonyms. In this case, unless we are explicitly consented, we only reveal the pseudonym of a living artist. This aligns with the practice of authority files in national libraries, CISAC and IFPI affiliates.

### Location and nationality {.unnumbered}

We do not collect, unless consented, data on ethnicity. However, for the purpose of Slovak cultural policy and media regulation, we need to know if the works of a person meet the local content guidelines, which is derived from the nationality, place of birth or residence status of the artist.

As explained in @sec-sensitive-data, by principle, we do not expose this sensitive data, but we infer if the person's works meet the local content regulation.

-   In case of people, we create a special location property which states that the person is local to Slovakia.

-   In the case of works, we apply a special property, is heritage of Slovakia; or is heritage of Slovaks.

Historically, many Czech, Austrian and Hungarian nationals lived in Slovakia, and currently the Slovak Republic provides temporary protection to many Ukrainian (and other) nationals. Regardless of ethnicity, these people may fall under the local content guidelines, and for this media regulatory purpose we claim that they are local to Slovakia. We use qualifiers to ensure that this is not part of their personal identity, but a legal fact about their compositions.

In the case of works, a work and its recorded fixation meets the Slovak local content regulation if it uses the Slovak language, or it is composed by a person who meets the local content regulation's definitions, regardless of ethnicity or nationality. When we claim that a work is a heritage of "Slovaks", we use it in a narrow sense: for composed works, we refer to Slovaks as an ethnolinguistic group who use the Slovak language. The heritage of "Slovakia" is any work composed by qualifying persons.

Last, but not least, non-vocal authentic folk music of Slovaks is also a heritage of Slovakia. In this case, to avoid misunderstandings, we use "authentic Slovak folk music" as a genre, i.e., a property of the music, and not its unknown composer or performer.

### Repertoire Data {.unnumbered}

### Sound recordings {.unnumbered}

A **sound recording** is the actual captured sound: a specific audio performance fixed in a sound file or master. Under the ISRC (International Standard Recording Code) standard, each distinct sound recording is identified by a unique ISRC. Different edits, remasters, or versions of the same performance typically receive different ISRCs, because they represent different sound recordings [@iso_isrc_2019].

#### ISRC Country Code {.unnumbered}

The ISRC country code does not refer to a country as a geopolitical entity, but to an organisation that registers sound recordings with a territorial jurisdiction. For example, *Association of Hungarian Record Companies* (Mahasz, [omo:Q2035](https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2035) ), the Hungarian national IPI Group member, handles the ISRC codes starting with `HU`. In this respect, the `HU` part of the ISRC code does not refer to Hungary but to Mahasz.

In most cases, `HU` and other ISRC country codes coincide with the country code of the jurisdiction, but several large countries ran out of their identifier range, and have multiple top-level codes, like the U.S., Brazil or Germany; and ISRC reserved some top-level registration codes for technical purposes, too.

#### ISRC Registration Country {.unnumbered}

For example, *Association of Hungarian Record Companies* (Mahasz, [omo:Q2035](https://reprexbase.eu/openmusic/Item:Q2035) ), handles the registrations on the territory of Hungary. Whenever the top-level registrar corresponds with a geopolitical entity, we placed the entity's name in this variable, including non-sovereign entities like Hong Kong or French Southern Territories. The non-territorial codes are marked with *No agency \[exception\]*.

Our aim was the study of Slovak and Hungarian registrations in and outside of their registrars, and the algorithms we used collected a lot of identifiers that fell out of the scope of these countries.

#### ISRC Designation Code {.unnumbered}

This range usually identifies a label or a rights management company that handles recording-side royalties. The reason why they cannot be directly mapped to labels is that certain designation codes were allocated to labels that were dissolved, or merged into newer entities, or have other successors. They can be seen as a provenance variable for the particular registration. Unfortunately, we know that often the same recording receives new ISRC codes when the previous registering body or its administration recards are no longer available.

### Release {.unnumbered}

A **release** is a packaged publication of one or more recordings made available to the public. In DDEX terminology, a release groups recordings together in a specific commercial or distribution context, such as an album, single, EP, or digital compilation. The same recording can appear on multiple releases (for example, an album release, a single release, and a compilation), while retaining the same ISRC.

Unfortunately, as our research shows, new releases often receive a new ISRC code.
